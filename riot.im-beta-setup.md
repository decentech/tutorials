# What's So Innovative About It?
Originally launched at Decentralized Web Summit in Jun 2016, as Vector, Riot allows you to own your own data. It's a bridge between the sea of communication apps.

Unlike Signal, Riot is not tied to your telephone number or the Android's 'Google Play' framework.

# What's the Riot Stance on Privacy?
We stand behind the idea that all of us should have the right to control our online data and that sharing this data is a choice. We will not contribute to the ever growing belief that simply because something is free that by default you should give up your right to privacy.

Vector is a fully decentralized system, allowing anyone to run their own server in order to keep control over their data, and with the ability to provide an end-to-end encrypted service coming in our next release. Privacy and data ownership is critical to us.

Signal requires SMS confirmation which can be intercepted in authoritarian states. Riot does not require this.
