# decen.tech Tutorials

It's been my intention to create a grassroots event surrounding decentralised web technologies. In an effort to actively engage in this area I'll be adding a variety of tutorials to inspire others to get stuck into the basics.

Think of it like a book club or code club! Learn, test, grow, share, mentor: are the conerstones of our vision.
